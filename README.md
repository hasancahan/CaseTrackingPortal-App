This is the project I did when I was accepted to the company I worked for before.

The aim of this project was to create a portal where we can control and observe the lawsuits and legal processes filed against our company.

The portal, which I completed in a short period of 2 months, working for a total of 40 days, was my first .net MVC layer project.
